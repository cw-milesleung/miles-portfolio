## Projects

### [ROT Cipher]

ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, which was used in ancient Rome. The term "ROT13" stands for "rotate by 13 places."

ROT13 is often used as a basic form of encryption to hide text, especially in situations where a simple and reversible transformation is sufficient. It is not a secure encryption method and is mainly used for obfuscation rather than providing real security. ROT13 is also used humorously on the internet to hide spoilers or other content that users may not want to see accidentally.

Any integer from 1 to 25 is also available to cycle through different possibilities.
